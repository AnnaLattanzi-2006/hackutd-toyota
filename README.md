Toyota Compare Page – Redesign (Hackathon Project)
Overview

This project is a redesigned and re-worked version of Toyota’s “Compare” page (toyota.com/compare). Our goal is to make comparing Toyota models faster, clearer, and more visually engaging while keeping the design simple, responsive, and aligned with Toyota’s brand style.
